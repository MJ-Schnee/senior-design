# Dungeon Crawler

Our senior design project is a virtual board game. The rules and mechanics of the game are inspired by the Dungeons & Dragons board games. As a virtual game, some rules and mechanics can be automated, which allowed us to create mechanics that wouldn't be possible with a physical game. We used the Unity game engine to create the game with the free assets it provides for students. The latest game version can be found on the github [releases](https://github.com/MJ-Schnee/senior-design/releases) page.

## [FAQ]

Q: Could you implement a machine learning algorithm to control the players?

A: We could, but there's no reason to trivialize this game like that, so we won't.

<br/>

Q: What other applications does this project have besides being a video game?

A: You could argue that it could be used for a tactical simmulation.

<br/>

Q: Where will future developement lead on this project?

A: Online multiplayer and a larger number of goals and features.

<br/>

Q: Are there other game modes?

A: Additional game modes will be added with more quest options.

<br/>

Q: Can I run the release version on Linux or an apple machine?

A: No. We will not be releasing betas for these platforms.

<br/>

Q: Will this game be published on Steam?

A: Maybe, if we can manage to make the game look better after adding some new features.
