# Senior Design

Our senior design project will be an online virtual board game. The rules and mechanics of the game are inspired by the Dungeons & Dragons board games. As a virtual game, some rules and mechanics can be automated, allowing us to create mechanics that wouldn't be possible with a physical game. We will be using the Unity game engine to create the game with the free assets it provides for students.
