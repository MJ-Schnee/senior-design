## Project Constraints Essay

This project faces constraints in several areas, including economic, professional, ethical, and legal aspects.

Economically, our team will rely on free tools and open-source assets due to a limited budget. While this will keep our costs low, it limits our access to premium and professional assets which could hinder the polish of the final product. Without external funding, we must carefully prioritize what we can use from open-source assets and what we must develop ourselves.

Professionally, this project offers a valuable opportunity for us to develop skills in game development and teamwork. The learning curve for this could slow down our development, though, and potentially limit the scope of the final product. It is best to deliver a polished and functional game, however, the most important part is ensuring we work hard at improving our skills.

Ethically, our team needs to ensure the game is inclusive and accessible to a broad range of players. We need to be mindful to avoid unintentional harmful stereotypes or behaviors as well as ensuring there are accessibility features to ensure everyone can access the game. By designing the game with these ethics in mind, we can ensure our project can be enjoyed by diverse audiences.

Legally, we need to be careful of how we implement our project. We draw inspiration from the D&D Adventure System Board Games, however, we need to ensure that no copyrighted material or proprietary mechanics are used. This has the potential to limit creative aspects of the game, so we need to pay careful attention to originality and ensure we won't run into legal issues.
