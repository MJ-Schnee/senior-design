This project allowed me to build up my game design skills, including using the Unity game engine and forced me to learn c#. I'm proud to say I am decently familiar with both now. I also learned a very small amount about 3D modeling and animation. I am most proud of my contributions with model editing, the game's main menu screen, character class options, and the quest tracking/game completion system.
I had a lot of problems with linking and coding in the Unity editor since I was originally not familiar with it or c# at the beginning of the project. I was able to overcome these obstacles with the help of the online unity tutorial courses and the unity documentation. One of the largest obstacles I overcame was the quest system. It allows a behavior to be attached to the game manager during runtime that hooks into the game managers tracked statistics to determine the state of the game and update the player on their progress and current goal. Overall I am impressed with the end product and feel accomplished for my efforts.
