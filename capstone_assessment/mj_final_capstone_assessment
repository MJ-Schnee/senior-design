My individual contributions to this project largely involved managing the team, setting up meetings, ensuring we met deadlines, sourcing assets, and development of the game itself. All of my individual contributions are available on our public GitHub repository and the development over time of the project and its shifting goals is also available there.
I believe I did apply and build upon the skills I identified in my initial assessment from last Fall. Specifically, I believe that I improved in the areas of planning, management , and communication. In regards to planning, I believe that I have greatly improved my skills of setting goals for where we want to go and then regularly meeting to check on the progress towards those goals and obstacles in the way. Management developed similarly as I learned how to distribute workloads among the team and organize events for us to get together and check in on progress. My communication skills were also put to the test through both a mix of the two other skills as well as communicating my idea for the game itself, the code I wrote, and why I wrote it how I did or why I did. In this regard I believe that my successes were that I improved in all of these areas immensely and now have good experience to them, knowing my strengths and weaknesses. I believe that the obstacles were the lack of experience to begin with and getting myself motivated to work and ensuring that the product was to the standard we wished.
