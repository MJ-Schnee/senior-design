## Rules
### Hit Points
Every player and each enemy has a number of hit points. If an enemy's hit points reach 0, that enemy dies and is removed from the game. If a player's hit points reaches 0, they fall unconscious and must use an action and a healing surge at the start of their turn.
### Actions
Each player and enemy gains 2 actions at the start of each of their turns. They may use an action to move, attack, or use an item that requires an action. All actions are lost at the end of each turn so make sure to use them up!
### Staying Fresh
All multiple use player actions gain a +2 bonus called 'fresh' at the beginning of the game, with the exception of the move action. This bonus is removed once the action has been used. Using a fresh action does not impose stale on that action until it is used again.
### Going Stale
After a player uses an action that action receives a 'stale' penalty. Attacks receive a stale penalty of -2 and moving incurs a -1 penalty to the player's movement speed. Every stale penalty a player has is reduced by 1 at the end of that player's turn. For example, a player that attacks once and moves once on their turn will end their turn with a -1 penalty to that attack and no penalty to their movement speed. However, a player that moves twice will have a -1 penalty to their speed at the end of their turn.
### Tiles
Players will appear at the edge of a village at the start of the game. Starting from the edge players can explore into the village. Players automatically discover new tiles within a 6 tile radius of their character's position. Discovered tiles remain discovered until the end of the game. A discovered monster tiles immediately create its monster, which takes its turns immediately after each of the turns of the player that discovered it. With a few exceptions, monsters may only move through discovered tiles.
